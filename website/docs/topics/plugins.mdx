Plugins are responsible for running and defining middleware, currently
there is only one official plugin, the gateway plugin.

:::info

We are planning to add more plugins in the future, such as
interactions.

## Using Plugins

You define the plugins that you will use to `createClient`,
for example:

```js
import createClient from '@cordjs/client'

createClient([SomePlugin, SomeOtherPlugin])
```

Plugins can also accept options, for example:

```js
createClient([
  [
    SomePlugin,
    {
      foo: 'bar',
    },
  ],
])
```

## Creating Plugins

To create a plugin, create a class that extends `Plugin`.

```js
import { Plugin } from '@cordjs/client'

class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  constructor(options) {
    this.id = 'my-cool-plugin'

    super(options, [
      'foo', // these are your middleware
      'bar',
    ])
  }
}
```

:::info

Check the source of the
[gateway plugin](https://github.com/lukadev-0/cord.js/blob/main/packages/gateway/src/index.js)
for more information, and if you are using TypeScript you can see the typings there.
