:::caution Work in Progress

Cord.js is a work in progress.

If you encounter any issues,
please report them [here](https://github.com/lukadev-0/cord.js/issues).

:::

Lets make a Discord bot!

## Before we Begin

Make sure you have created an
application on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
and that you've created a bot, and copied the token!

:::danger

Do not share your token with anyone, as it allows the person
to login as your bot and impersonate it.

They will also gain all permissions granted to your bot.

:::

## Creating a new project

Create a `package.json` by using the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm init
```

## Installing Packages

We need to install some packages.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @cordjs/client @cordjs/gateway
```

`@cordjs/client` is the package which will manage middleware and plugins

`@cordjs/gateway` is the package which will allow us to receive events from the gateway

## Writing some code

Lets start writing code!

Create an index.js file. We will need to require the
packages that we have just installed.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cjs"
  values={[
    { label: 'CommonJS', value: 'cjs' },
    { label: 'ESM', value: 'esm' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="cjs">

```js
const { Client } = require('@cordjs/client')
const { Gateway } = require('@cordjs/gateway')
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="esm">

```js
import Client from '@cordjs/client'
import Gateway from '@cordjs/gateway'
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Creating a client

Now we'll need to create a client.
We will also need to specify the plugins, we are using the gateway plugin
in order to receive events from the Discord gateway, such as a message
being created.

```js
const client = new Client({
  plugins: [
    Gateway({
      // Paste the token from the developer portal here
      token: 'PASTE YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE',

      client: {
        intents: ['GUILDS', 'GUILD_MESSAGES'],
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Adding Middleware

Now we will need to add a middleware.

```js
client.gateway.messageCreate(ctx => {
  const [msg] = ctx.data

  if (msg.content === 'hello') {
    msg.reply('Hello there!')
  }
})
```

This middleware will run whenever `messageCreate` has been fired.

:::info

The gateway plugin uses Discord.js under the hood.

`messageCreate` can be replaced with
any other [Discord.js event](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client)

:::

### Starting it

Now, we will need to actually start the bot,
the `client.start()` function will do that,
it will start any plugins, in this case the gateway plugin
will establish a connection to the gateway.

```js
client.start()
```

## Testing your bot

Now you can run your index.js file, and invite your bot
to a server, and type

> hello

If everything is correct, then the bot should respond with

> Hello there!
