:::caution Work in Progress

Cord.js is a work in progress.

If you encounter any issues,
please report them [here](https://github.com/lukadev-0/cord.js/issues).

:::

This guide will walk you through the basics of using Cord.js, and get
you a basic bot up and running.

## Before we Begin

Make sure you have created an
application on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

You also need to add a bot to your application, which can be done in the
Bot tab.

You'll also need to add the bot to your server, which can be done in the
OAuth2 > URL Generator tab, select the `bot` tab and copy the URL into
your browser.

You will also need the bot token, which can be found in the `Bot` tab.

:::danger

Do not share your token with anyone, as it allows the person
to login as your bot and impersonate it.

They will also gain all permissions granted to your bot.

:::

## Creating a new project

First, we'll need to initialize a new project.

```bash npm2yarn
npm init
```

## Installing Packages

Now we'll install the packages we need.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @cordjs/client @cordjs/gateway
```

`@cordjs/client` is the main package, it handles middleware and plugins

`@cordjs/gateway` is the package which will allow us to receive events from the gateway

## Writing some code

Lets start writing code!

Create an index.js file. We will need to require the
packages that we have just installed.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cjs"
  values={[
    { label: 'CommonJS', value: 'cjs' },
    { label: 'ESM', value: 'esm' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="cjs">

```js
const { createClient } = require('@cordjs/client')
const { Gateway } = require('@cordjs/gateway')
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="esm">

```js
import createClient from '@cordjs/client'
import Gateway from '@cordjs/gateway'
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Creating a client

Now we'll need to create a client.

We will also need to specify the plugins we're going to use.
We are going to use the gateway plugin, it allows us to receive events from the gateway.

```js
const client = new Client({
  plugins: [
    Gateway({
      // Paste the token from the developer portal here
      token: 'PASTE YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE',

      client: {
        intents: ['GUILDS', 'GUILD_MESSAGES'],
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Adding Middleware

We are going to use _middleware_. A powerful feature
that allows us to listen for events, it also allows
us to handle errors.

```js
client.gateway.messageCreate(ctx => {
  const [msg] = ctx.data

  if (msg.content === 'hello') {
    msg.reply('Hello there!')
  }
})
```

This middleware will run whenever `messageCreate` has been fired.

:::info

The gateway plugin uses Discord.js under the hood.

`messageCreate` can be replaced with
any other [Discord.js event](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client)

:::

### Starting it

Now, we will need to actually start the bot,
the `client.start()` function will do that.

The gateway plugin will connect to the gateway whenever
we call `client.start()`.

```js
client.start()
```

Your bot is now online!

Test it by sending "hello" to the bot, if everything is correct,
it should respond with "Hello there!".
