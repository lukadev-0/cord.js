The gateway plugin allows you receive events from the gateway.
It uses Discord.js under the hood.

The gateway plugin accepts 3 options

- **token** - The token of the Discord bot
- **client** - Options for the Discord.js client
- **catchAll?** - (default: false) If true, the `emit`
  method will be overwritten and all events will be
  catched, if disabled, event listeners are added
  using the middleware that are added.

## Example

See the [gateway example](https://github.com/lukadev-0/cord.js/tree/master/examples/gateway)
